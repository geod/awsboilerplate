## Comparison to Alternatives

For a team creating a startup there are a number of options. Each cell can be debated / there are different opinions.

| Option | Ease of Getting Started / Learning Curve | Developer Experience* | Flexibility** | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| awsboilerplate (cdk/aws native) | Easy |  Okay | High | Low |
| Codepipeline or Jenkins etc ontop of Terraform / Cloudformation | Difficult | Poor | High | Low |
| Heroku | Super Easy | Superb | Moderate | High |
| Amplify | Easy | Okay | Low/Moderate | Low |
| Porter | Easy | Good | Low/Moderate | Low |

CDK/AWS Native is not quite there in terms of developer experience (yet) and AWS is maturing the tooling. 
However, it is a viable option and if it is improved over the next few quarters it could be compelling offering
both ease of getting started and expressive power.

\** Both for the developers creating/administering the full stack and ongoing dev experience

\* When your use-case deviates from what the solution provides how easy can you customize
